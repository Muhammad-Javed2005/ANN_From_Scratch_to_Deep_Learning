##  Project Overview

**ANN From Scratch to Deep Learning** is a complete **beginner-to-advanced study repository** developed by **Muhammad Javed**.

This repository focuses on understanding **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** from first principles — starting from the **Perceptron model** and gradually moving towards **deep learning concepts** like backpropagation, optimizers, regularization, and dropout.

The goal is to **build strong conceptual foundations** by implementing core ideas step-by-step instead of treating neural networks as black boxes.

##  Learning Objectives

- Understand how Artificial Neural Networks work internally
- Learn mathematical intuition behind ANN components
- Implement ANN concepts step-by-step in Python
- Understand overfitting and how to prevent it
- Prepare for **ML interviews, exams, and real-world projects**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11  
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
